# BEATCF-Paper1
Python / R Code used for generating the Figures and Tables for BEATCF Baseline Manuscript 

## Creating the database
The python file that creates the database and the derived tables that are used for the tables are created from BEATCF_database.ipynb
The file works running the data extract created from Research Path - 9 November 2023 and DataDictionary(20230317).xlsx

## Creating the tables
The tables are created by connecting to the created beatcf database and running BEAT-CF_enrolment_tables.Rmd
